### 1. Two Sum


This code solves the **Two Sum** problem.  
Given a list of integers (`nums`) and a target number (`target`), the goal is to find **two numbers** in the list whose sum equals the target and return their **indices**.

#### Example

```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
# Output: [0, 1]

### 2. Palindrome Number
- **Approach**: Convert the number to a string and check if it reads the same forwards and backwards.  
- **Complexity**:  
  - Time: O(n) where n is the number of digits  
  - Space: O(1) (ignoring string conversion)  
- **Key Idea**: Simple string reversal is enough, but thereâ€™s also a math-based approach without string conversion.
